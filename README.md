## Learning Journey

These projects represent my progression as a developer. Through building these applications, I've gained practical experience with:

- Front-end web development fundamentals
- Working with APIs and external data sources
- Problem-solving and algorithm implementation
- User interface design principles
- Writing clean, maintainable code

## How to Run the Projects

### TicTacToe Game
1. Navigate to the `TicTacToeJS` directory
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Play the game by clicking on the grid cells
4. Use the "Reset Game" button to start a new game

### Weather App
1. Navigate to the `Whether-app` directory
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. **Important:** You'll need to get your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the `script.js` file
4. Enter a city name in the search box and click the search button
5. View current weather conditions and the 5-day forecast

## Future Plans

I'm continuously working on adding new projects to this portfolio. Upcoming additions will explore:

- React.js applications
- Backend development with Node.js
- Database integration
- Full-stack web applications
